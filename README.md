# Priyansh Singh – Portfolio

This repository hosts my personal developer portfolio, designed to present my technical skills, projects, and experience in a clear, modern, and production-focused manner.

The portfolio reflects my work across **AI/ML**, **Agentic AI**, **MLOps**, and **Full-Stack Development**, with an emphasis on real-world system design rather than just isolated demos.

## About Me
I am an AI/ML Engineer and Full-Stack Developer focused on building end-to-end, scalable, and deployment-ready systems. My interests lie in designing intelligent applications that combine machine learning, automation, APIs, and modern web technologies.

I enjoy working on projects that move beyond theory and experimentation into real production workflows, including model deployment, monitoring, and user-facing applications.

## What This Portfolio Showcases
- A detailed overview of my skills and technical background  
- AI/ML projects covering machine learning, deep learning, and intelligent systems  
- Agentic AI applications involving autonomous decision-making and workflows  
- Full-stack web applications with clean UI and robust backend integration  
- MLOps practices such as experiment tracking, model versioning, and deployment pipelines  
- Clear ways to connect and collaborate with me  

## Project Philosophy
All showcased projects follow a **production-first mindset**, focusing on:
- Clean and maintainable code structure  
- Scalability and performance considerations  
- Real-world use cases instead of toy examples  
- Proper separation of frontend, backend, and ML components  

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Vite, React, TypeScript  
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS, shadcn-ui  
- **Architecture:** Component-based, modular, and scalable design  
- **Deployment:** Cloud-first approach with modern CI/CD practices  

## Design Approach
The portfolio is built with a modern dark theme, smooth animations, and a minimal yet expressive UI. The goal is to balance aesthetics with usability, ensuring the content remains the main focus while maintaining a professional and contemporary look.

## Purpose of This Repository
This repository serves as:
- A central place to showcase my work and skills  
- A technical profile for internships, full-time roles, and collaborations  
- A continuously evolving space that grows as I build and learn more
